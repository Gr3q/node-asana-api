/**
 * An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
 * observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to
 * the target location of an active webhook.
 *
 * The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
 * subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
 * modified it, the eventâ€™s user will be user B. Note: Some events
 * are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
 * consumers should make sure to handle this case.
 *
 * The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
 * that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
 * example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
 * contained within the project.
 *
 * **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
 * `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
 * `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
 * itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
 * within the resource's fields have been modified.
 *
 * For instance, consider these scenarios:
 *
 *
 * * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
 * `added`, `Event.parent` will be on object with the `id` and
 * `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.
 *
 *
 * * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
 * `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
 * `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
 * be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
 *
 *
 * * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
 * be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
 * `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
 * an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
